# Strategies for AI-Assisted Coding

## 1. Iterative Copy-Paste
- Plan with ChatGPT
  - GPT-4o follows instructions best
  - GPT-5 has more robust and creative solutions
- Copy relevant files into chat. Copy code outputs back into codebase.
- Ask GPT-4o and GPT-5 to generate independent solutions and review each other's code.

#### Pros
- High degree of user control
- Works well for isolated changes, single files
- Can refine code very precisely
- Remembers historical context and prior plans

#### Cons
- Context only comes through manual copy-paste
  - Unsustainable with large, interconnected codebases
- Historical context can get out of date
- Juggles several different chats for each task
